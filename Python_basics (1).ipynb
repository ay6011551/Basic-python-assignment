        "\n",
        "-> Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn and use. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is known for its simple, readable syntax, which makes it a great language for beginners. Unlike some other programming languages, Python doesn’t use complicated rules or symbols, so it's easier to understand and write.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Python is popular for several reasons:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Easy to learn:** Python's syntax is simple, which makes it beginner-friendly. You can write programs quickly and focus more on learning concepts than on learning the language itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   **Versatile:** Python can be used for many different types of projects like web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and even game development.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Large Community:** There are many resources available to learn Python, including tutorials, forums, and books. The Python community is very helpful to beginners.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Libraries and Frameworks:** Python has many pre-built libraries and frameworks that make it easier to do tasks like web development (Django, Flask), data science (Pandas, NumPy), and machine learning (TensorFlow, scikit-learn).\n",
